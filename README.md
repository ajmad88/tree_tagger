# tree_tagger
Web application built for client to display the locations of trees harvested by clients company in the twin cities area.  The app is meant for the clients woodworking business.  When they harvest a tree the create different products from it and the app is meant to be for the customer.  The customer will recieve their product from the clients store and along with it will be the ID number for the tree it came from.  The customer will be able to then go to the website and type in that id number.  The website will then produce the location, approximate age and a brief description of the tree.  Future plans for the website include something along the lines of including a QR code to read instead of the id number to type in.
